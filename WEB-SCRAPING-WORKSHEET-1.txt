13. What are static and dynamic web pages?
Answer: 
A static web page contains Web pages with fixed content. Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same information to every visitor. Static sites are the most basic type of website and are the easiest to create. Unlike dynamic websites, they do not require any complex Web programming or database design. A static site can be built by simply creating a few HTML pages and publishing them to a Web server.	A dynamic web page, the Content of pages is different for different visitors. It takes more time to load than the static web page.

At a basic level, a dynamic website can give the website owner the ability to simply update and add new content to the site. For example, news and events could be posted to the site through a simple browser interface. Dynamic features of a site are only limited by imagination. Some examples of dynamic website features could be: content management system, e-commerce system, bulletin / discussion boards, intranet or extranet facilities, ability for clients or users to upload documents, ability for administrators or users to create content or add information to a site (dynamic publishing).
