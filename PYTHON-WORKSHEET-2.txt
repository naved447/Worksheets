Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly
11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.
Answer: 
A list is a sequence of elements in a specific order. You can access elements with a numerical index, e.g. the_list[3]. The time taken for several operations such as testing if the list contains an element is O(n), i.e. proportional to the length of the list.
A tuple is basically an immutable list, meaning you can't add, remove, or replace any elements.
A set has no order, but has the advantage over a list that testing if the set contains an element is much faster, almost regardless of the size of the set. It also has some handy operations such as union and intersection.
A dictionary is a mapping from keys to values where the keys can be all sorts of different objects, in contrast to lists where the 'keys' can only be numbers. So you can have the_dict = {'abc': 3, 'def': 8} and then the_dict['abc'] is 3. They keys of a dict are much like a set: they have no order and you can test for their existence quickly.

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’ with space in python.

Answer: strings are mutable in python.
here you find the code:

str = "I+Love+Python"
print(str.replace("+", " "))

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python.
Answer: The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
x = ord("a")

print(x)
output: 97

type() is the function to get data type of a variable in python.
Example
a=4
type(a)
output: int
Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.
14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form ????2 + ???? + ?? = 0. Where a, b and c are to be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0.
Answer:
import cmath

a = int(input("Enter a: "))
b = int(input("Enter b: "))
c = int(input("Enter c: "))

#discriminant
d = (b**2) -(4*a*c)

eq1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
eq2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)

print('The solution are {0} and {1}'.format(eq1,eq2))

15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input the value of ‘n’.
Answer:
n = int(input('Enter number of natural number to find sum: '))

if n>0:
    sum = n*(n+1)/2
    print("Sum of first {} number is {}".format(n,int(sum)))
else:
    print("enter positive number")
